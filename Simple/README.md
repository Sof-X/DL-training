## SimpleNN
using cifar10 dataset ( the URL to download the dataset is already in a library so u don't need it)
- We define the classes
- Create NN and CNN with *models.Sequential* and Compile , Train with model.fit
- **Classification Report**
- model.Evaluate uses the trained model and feeds it the x_test data and then compares prediction to y_test without updating the weights.(like doing 1 more epoch)
